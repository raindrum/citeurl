CiteURL is an extensible tool to process long and shortform legal citations in text and generate links to various websites where you can view the cited language for free. Here's an example of what it can do:

| Sample Input                                                 | Output                                                       |

| Federal law provides that courts should award prevailing civil rights plaintiffs reasonable attorneys fees, 42 USC ยง 1988(b), and, by discretion, expert fees, *id.* at (c). This is because the importance of civil rights litigation cannot be measured by a damages judgment. *See* *Riverside v. Rivera*, 477 U.S. 561 (1986). But *Evans v. Jeff D.* upheld a settlement where the plaintiffs got everything they wanted, on condition that they waive attorneys' fees. 475 U.S. 717 (1986). This ruling lets savvy defendants create a wedge between plaintiffs and their attorneys, discouraging civil rights suits and undermining the court's logic in *Riverside*, 477 U.S. at 574-78. | Federal law provides that courts should award prevailing civil rights plaintiffs reasonable attorneys fees, [42 USC ยง 1988(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1988#b), and, by discretion, expert fees, [*id.* at (c)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1988#c).

By default, CiteURL supports Bluebook-style citations to [over 130 sources](https://github.com/raindrum/citeurl/blob/main/citeurl/builtin-templates.yaml) of U.S. law, including:

- most state and federal court cases
- the U.S. Code and Code of Federal Regulations
- the U.S. Constitution and all state constitutions
- codified laws for every state and territory except Arkansas, Georgia, Guam, and Puerto Rico.

You can also customize CiteURL to support more sources of law by [writing your own citation templates](https://raindrum.github.io/citeurl/template-yamls/) in YAML format.

If you want to try out CiteURL's citation lookup features without installing anything, you can use [Law Search](https://raindrum.github.io/lawsearch), a JavaScript implementation of CiteURL I maintain on my website.

## Installation

CiteURL has been tested with Python version 3.9, but earlier versions probably work too. Install Python if you don't have it, then run this command:

```bash
python -m pip install citeurl
```

## Usage

Look up a single citation and open it directly in a browser:

```bash
citeurl "42 usc 1983" -l -b
```

Process a court opinion or other text, and output a version where every citation is converted into an HTML hyperlink:

```bash
citeurl -i INPUT_FILE.html -o OUTPUT_FILE.html
```

Write your own [citation templates](https://raindrum.github.io/citeurl/template-yamls/), then host a server where people on your local network can look up citations to any sources of law you need:

```bash
citeurl -s -t PATH_TO_YOUR_TEMPLATES.YAML
```

Pipe a text to CiteURL and get a list of the top ten authorities it cites, ordered by the number of citations to each:

```bash
cat INPUT_FILE.html | citeurl -a 10
```

For more options, run `citeurl -h`.

Besides to the command-line tool, CiteURL can be used in a few other forms:

- [a tool to generate](https://raindrum.github.io/citeurl/frontends#javascript) embeddable JavaScript so you can make your own instance of [Law Search](https://raindrum.github.io/lawsearch) with custom sources of law
- [a flexible Python library](https://raindrum.github.io/citeurl/library)
- [an extension](https://raindrum.github.io/citeurl/frontends#markdown-extension) to [Python-Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/)
- for Linux users, a [GNOME desktop search provider](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4225/gnome-citeurl-search-provider/)

## Credits

Many thanks to these websites, which CiteURL's default templates frequently link to:

- Harvard's [Caselaw Access Project](https://cite.case.law/) - for court cases
- Cornell's [Legal Information Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/) - for the U.S. Code and many federal rules
- [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org) - for the vast majority of state constitutions
- [LawServer.com](https://www.lawserver.com/tools/laws) - for statutes in about a dozen states and territories whose websites don't have a compatible URL scheme
