# Functions

Most of CiteURL's core features can be accessed through the Citator class. But if you plan to perform multiple operations with the same set of citations, you can use these module-wide functions without generating a whole new list of citations every time.

## insert_links()

::: citeurl.insert_links

## list_authorities()

::: citeurl.list_authorities
