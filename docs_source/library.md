This page documents how to include CiteURL in your Python programming projects.

The first step is to instantiate a [Citator](#citator), which by default contains all of CiteURL's built-in [Templates](#templates):

``` python
from citeurl import Citator
citator = Citator()
```

After that, you can feed it text to return a list of [Citations](#citation) it finds:

``` python
text = """
Federal law provides that courts should award prevailing civil rights plaintiffs reasonable attorneys fees, 42 USC ยง 1988(b), and, by discretion, expert fees, id. at (c). This is because the importance of civil rights litigation cannot be measured by a damages judgment. See Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561 (1986). But Evans v. Jeff D. upheld a settlement where the plaintiffs got everything they wanted, on condition that they waive attorneys' fees. 475 U.S. 717 (1986). This ruling lets savvy defendants create a wedge between plaintiffs and their attorneys, discouraging civil rights suits and undermining the court's logic in Riverside, 477 U.S. at 574-78.
"""
citations = citator.list_citations(text)
```

Once you have a list of citations, you can get information about each one:

```python
print(citations[0].text)
# 42 USC ยง 1988(b)
print(citations[0].tokens)
# {'title': '42', 'section': '1988', 'subsection': '(b)'}
print(citations[0].URL)
# https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1988#b
```

You can also use [insert_links()](#insert_links) to insert the citations back into the source text as HTML hyperlinks:

``` python
from citeurl import insert_links
output = insert_links(citations, text)
```

Or, you can use [list_authorities()](#list_authorities) to combine all the citations into a list of all the authorities cited in the text:

``` python
from citeurl import list_authorities

authorities = list_authorities(citations)
for authority in authorities:
    auth_cites = authority.citations
    print(f"{authority} was cited {len(auth_cites)} time(s)")

# 42 USC ยง 1988 was cited 2 time(s)
# 477 U.S. 561 was cited 2 time(s)
# 475 U.S. 717 was cited 1 time(s)
```
